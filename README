== G2Piwigo ==

G2Piwigo converts an existiung menalto Gallery2 installation to a shiny new Piwigo (http://www.piwigo.org) gallery.
The following properties are preserved:

* Titles, summaries, and descriptions for images and (sub)albums
* Sort order for (sub)albums
* Highlight images for (sub)albums

The following properties are not (yet) converted:

* comments
* ratings
* keywords
* thumbnails

=== Running the script ===

The script accesses the G2 and piwigo sql databases and updates piwigo after a local quick sync 

* first copy the contents of g2data/albums to piwigo/galleries
* generate piwigo thumbnails (in the piwigo admin panel)
* then syncronize in the piwigo admin panel to seed the db.
* now run the script in the piwigo/galleries folder as:

find |grep -v /thumbnail | cut -c3- | PATHTOSCRIPT/convertcomments.pl g2_database g2_db_password piwigo_database piwigo_db_password

(this will pass a list of paths to the actual images, while filtering out the thumbnail subfolders)

=== Finishing up ===

* You will need to install and activate the "Extended Comments" plugin for the album descriptions to show up correctly!
* In the admin interface under tools->maintenance click on "Update albums information" and "Update photos information"

Done!
